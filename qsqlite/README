This is a sliglty adjusted version of the QSQLITE driver. Install this driver
somewhere in the QT_PLUGIN_PATH and use it in akonadi by setting the driver
to QSQLITE3.

NOTE: For this driver to compile you'll need to compile sqlite with the 
      -DSQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY flag enabled. This is experimental API so
      don't expect it do be enabled by default on you distro.
